\chapter{\setupgeom}

The program utility \setupgeom{} can help in preparing the input geometry 
for transport calculations, following the rules specified in the Transport section.
Starting from a geometry that can be the output of a previous relaxation step or 
any other building step, \setupgeom{} can be used to specify the system partitioning 
into \emph{contacts} and \emph{device} regions and reorder the atom numbers such that
the \emph{device} is placed before the \emph{contacts}. Additionally the tool reorders the
atoms of the two PLs of each contact or can create the second PL if only one is specified.
Finally, the \emph{device} region is reordered and partitioned into PLs for more
efficient Green's function calculations.
A practical example is discussed in \dftbp{} recipes.

\section{Input for \setupgeom}

The input of the code must be named \verb|setup_in.hsd| and should be a
Human-friendly Structured Data (HSD) formatted file (see Appendix \ref{sec:hsd}).

The file is similar to the \dftbp{} input, where just 2 sections are needed. 
The table below contains the list of the properties, that must occur in the
input file:

\begin{ptableh}
  \kw{Geometry} & p|m &  & - & \pref{sec:dftbp.Geometry} \\
  \kw{Transport} & p & & \cb & \\
\end{ptableh}

\begin{description}
\item[\is{Geometry}] Specifies the geometry for the system to be
  calculated.  See p.~\pref{sec:dftbp.Geometry}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Transport\{\}}
\label{sec:setup.Transport}

The transport block must specify the atoms in each contact.  
An example of the \verb|Transport| section is reported below:

\begin{verbatim}
Transport {
    Contact {
      Id = "source"
     	Atoms [zeroBased] = {9:24 56:78}
     	ContactVector = 0.0 0.0 3.78
     	NumSpecifiedPLs = 2
    }
    Contact {
      Id = "drain"
      Atoms [zeroBased] = {81:100}
     	ContactVector = 0.0 0.0 3.78
      NumSpecifiedPLs = 2
    }
    Task = SetupGeometry{
      PLCutoff [AA] = 5.0
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
  

\begin{ptable}
 \kw{Id}    & s & &   &  \\
 \kw{Atoms} &l i& & - & \pref{Atoms} \\
 \kw{NumSpecifiedPLs} &i & & 2 & \\	
 \kw{ContactVector} & 3r & & - & \\	
 \kw{PLCutoff} & r & & 10.0 &\\ 
\end{ptable}

\begin{description}
\item[\is{Id}] Specifies a unique contact name.
\item[\is{Atoms}] Sets the list of atoms belonging to the named contact. This list can
	be easily obtained using some external atomic manipulation tool like for instance Jmol. \\ 
	NOTE the modifier $[zeroBased]$ specifing that the defined atom numbers starts from $0$
	rather than $1$. Use $[oneBased]$ or no modifier for normal numbering starting from $1$.
\item[\is{NumSpecifiedPLs}] Specifies the number of PLs given for the named contact. If this value 
	is 2 (default) the total number of atoms in the contact are divided by 2 and the 2nd PL
	is reordered according to the 1st with the help of \kw{ContactVector}. If this value is 1, 
	the second PL is created, again using \kw{ContactVector}. 
\item[\is{ContactVector}] Sets the translation vector connecting the 2 PLs along the transport direction. 
	Since contact must be aligned to a cartesian axis, so must be this vector. Different contact
      can be in different directions. Also notice that the vector must be specified along the positive axis 
      direction.
\item[\is{PLCutoff}]  This value sets the cutoff distance of the Hamiltonian and Overlap electronic
     interactions. In transport calculations, trading off between accuracy and computational speed
     it is possible to cutoff the interactions shorter than the SK-tables, to about 5.0 Angstrom. 
     This cutoff changes the size of the PLs computed in the device region.	
\end{description}

\subsection{Code output}

The code writes two files, \verb|processed.gen| and \verb|transport.hsd|. The first file is the 
processed geometry, reordered according to the needs of transport calculations. The second 
contains the details of the geometry partitioning for transport, as described in the Transport 
section and that can be included in the input file.
For convenience this file also contains the \verb|SKTruncation| block in order to 
make the Hamiltonian consistent with the \kw{PLCutoff} set above.
